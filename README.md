# EthArchitect
A Ethereum Development Tool, to help other Ethereum developers build and maintain their dependencies and tools. In this tool will be the ability to install the stacks that currently exist and implement them onto various platforms in order ensure that the user has the dependencies required for each of the current frameworks and tools that are available. Adding new ones to the development of this tool, as I learn more about the blockchains and the tools that comprise them. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this development tool is to help consolidate all the requirements needed to utilize the current development tools that are available for the Ethereum blockchain, while simultaneously building tools that will be cross-developed across the blockchains. In order to develop tools to help make the development process a more pleasant experience. 

## Goals

## Development

### Stacks to be implemented
As I learn more and more about how to program and develop software, I am
